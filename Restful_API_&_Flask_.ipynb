It maps specific URL patterns to functions, called view functions, which return the response to the client.

Routing helps organize the application and control what content is shown for different web addresses.\n"

        "2. **Use the `request` object** to access data sent by the client (form data, JSON, etc.).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Use Authentication** – Implement API keys, tokens (like JWT), or OAuth to verify users.\n",
        "2. **Validate Input Data** – Check and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks.\n",
        "3. **Use HTTPS** – Encrypt communication between client and server.\n",
        "4. **Limit Request Rates** – Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse or DDoS attacks.\n",
        "5. **Enable CORS Carefully** – Control which domains can access your API.\n",
        "6. **Handle Errors Gracefully** – Avoid exposing sensitive server information.\n",
        "7. **Keep Dependencies Updated** – Use secure and up-to-date packages.\n",
        "8. **Use Flask Extensions** – Like `Flask-Login`, `Flask-JWT-Extended`, and `Flask-Limiter`.\n",
